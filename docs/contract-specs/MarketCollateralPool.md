# MarketCollateralPool (MarketCollateralPool.sol)

View Source: [contracts/marketprotocol/MarketCollateralPool.sol](../../contracts/marketprotocol/MarketCollateralPool.sol)

**â†— Extends: [Ownable](Ownable.md)**

**MarketCollateralPool**

This collateral pool houses all of the collateral for all market contracts currently in circulation.
 This pool facilitates locking of collateral and minting / redemption of position tokens for that collateral.

## Contract Members
**Constants & Variables**

```js
address public marketContractRegistry;
address public mktToken;
mapping(address => uint256) public contractAddressToCollateralPoolBalance;
mapping(address => uint256) public feesCollectedByTokenAddress;

```

**Events**

```js
event TokensMinted(address indexed marketContract, address indexed user, address indexed feeToken, uint256  qtyMinted, uint256  collateralLocked, uint256  feesPaid);
event TokensRedeemed(address indexed marketContract, address indexed user, uint256  longQtyRedeemed, uint256  shortQtyRedeemed, uint256  collateralUnlocked);
```

## Modifiers

- [onlyWhiteListedAddress](#onlywhitelistedaddress)

### onlyWhiteListedAddress

only can be called with a market contract address that currently exists in our whitelist
 this ensure's it is a market contract that has been created by us and therefore has a uniquely created
 long and short token address.  If it didn't we could have spoofed contracts minting tokens with a
 collateral token that wasn't the same as the intended token.

```js
modifier onlyWhiteListedAddress(address marketContractAddress) internal
```

**Arguments**

| Name        | Type           | Description  |
| ------------- |------------- | -----|
| marketContractAddress | address |  |

| marketContractAddress | address | address of the market contract to redeem tokens for | 
| qtyToMint | uint256 | quantity of long / short tokens to mint. | 
| isAttemptToPayInMKT | bool | if possible, attempt to pay fee's in MKT rather than collateral tokens | 

### redeemPositionTokens

Called by a user that currently holds both short and long position tokens and would like to redeem them
 for their collateral.

```js
function redeemPositionTokens(address marketContractAddress, uint256 qtyToRedeem) external nonpayable onlyWhiteListedAddress 
```

**Arguments**

| Name        | Type           | Description  |
| ------------- |------------- | -----|
| marketContractAddress | address | address of the market contract to redeem tokens for | 
| qtyToRedeem | uint256 | quantity of long / short tokens to redeem. | 

### settleAndClose

```

**Arguments**

| Name        | Type           | Description  |
| ------------- |------------- | -----|
| marketContractAddress | address | address of the MARKET Contract being traded. | 
| longQtyToRedeem | uint256 | qty to redeem of long tokens | 
| shortQtyToRedeem | uint256 | qty to redeem of short tokens | 

### withdrawFees

allows the owner to remove the fees paid into this contract for minting

```js
function withdrawFees(address feeTokenAddress, address feeRecipient) public nonpayable onlyOwner 
```

**Arguments**

| Name        | Type           | Description  |
| ------------- |------------- | -----|
| feeTokenAddress | address | - address of the erc20 token fees have been paid in |

### setMKTTokenAddress

allows the owner to update the mkt token address in use for fees

```js
function setMKTTokenAddress(address mktTokenAddress) public nonpayable onlyOwner 
```
